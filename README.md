  ## About me...

    I’m currently self learning to program. Until today I can create webpages with HTML and CSS, also I'm learning to code with javascript. I will be updating my porfolio, so feel free to check it out
    My professional carrer started with my license in Architecture, then and currently working on a kitchen's manufactury company in the area of engineering.
    
    I'm looking to practice so I can learn to code better, and so change my carrer path to be a fullstack and/or game developer
    
    That's all for now... see you soon with updates
